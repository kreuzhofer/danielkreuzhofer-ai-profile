summary: "Built and scaled a real-time collaboration platform from MVP to 50,000 active users."
highlights:
  - "Architected real-time sync system handling 10,000 concurrent connections"
  - "Implemented CI/CD pipeline reducing deployment time from 2 hours to 15 minutes"
  - "Led migration from monolith to microservices architecture"

depth:
  context: "Joined as the third engineer at an early-stage startup building a collaborative document editing platform. Wore many hats including frontend, backend, DevOps, and occasional customer support."
  challenges:
    - "Scaling WebSocket connections beyond initial server capacity"
    - "Maintaining data consistency across distributed clients"
    - "Zero-downtime deployments with limited infrastructure budget"
    - "Balancing feature development with technical debt"
  decisions:
    - title: "Real-time Architecture"
      situation: "Needed to support collaborative editing with conflict resolution"
      options:
        - "Operational Transformation (OT)"
        - "Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)"
        - "Last-write-wins with manual conflict resolution"
      chosen: "Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)"
      rationale: "CRDTs provided automatic conflict resolution without a central server, which was crucial for our offline-first requirements and reduced server load."
    - title: "Microservices Migration"
      situation: "Monolith was becoming difficult to scale and deploy"
      options:
        - "Continue with monolith, optimize hot paths"
        - "Full microservices architecture"
        - "Modular monolith with clear boundaries"
      chosen: "Modular monolith with clear boundaries"
      rationale: "We didn't have the team size to manage true microservices. Instead, we created clear module boundaries that could be extracted later if needed."
  outcomes:
    - metric: "Concurrent Users"
      value: "10,000+"
      context: "Peak concurrent WebSocket connections during product launches"
    - metric: "Deployment Frequency"
      value: "8x improvement"
      context: "From weekly releases to multiple daily deployments"
    - metric: "User Growth"
      value: "50,000 MAU"
      context: "Grew from 500 beta users to 50,000 monthly active users"
  lessons:
    - "Start simple and add complexity only when needed"
    - "Observability is not optional—invest in logging and monitoring early"
    - "The best architecture is one your team can actually maintain"
