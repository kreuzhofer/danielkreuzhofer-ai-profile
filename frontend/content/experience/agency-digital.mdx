depth:
  context: "First professional development role after completing a coding bootcamp. Worked in a fast-paced agency environment with tight deadlines and diverse client requirements."
  challenges:
    - "Rapid context switching between multiple client projects"
    - "Varying technical requirements from simple landing pages to complex web apps"
    - "Limited time for learning while meeting billable hour targets"
    - "Managing client expectations with changing requirements"
  decisions:
    - title: "Testing Strategy"
      situation: "QA was entirely manual and time-consuming"
      options:
        - "Continue with manual QA"
        - "Implement end-to-end testing"
        - "Start with unit tests for critical functions"
      chosen: "Start with unit tests for critical functions"
      rationale: "Unit tests provided the best ROI for our workflow—quick to write, fast to run, and caught most regressions before they reached QA."
    - title: "WordPress Framework"
      situation: "Each project started from scratch, duplicating effort"
      options:
        - "Use existing starter themes"
        - "Build custom starter framework"
        - "Adopt a page builder approach"
      chosen: "Build custom starter framework"
      rationale: "Existing themes didn't match our design workflow. A custom framework let us standardize our approach while maintaining flexibility for client needs."

    - "Every project is an opportunity to learn something new"
