bio: "I'm Daniel Kreuzhofer — 20+ years in IT, from building trading platforms at UniCredit to leading cloud architecture teams at AWS. Today I help companies in retail, finance, and insurance turn AI from buzzword into business results. Whether it's migrating to AWS, modernizing legacy apps, or implementing GenAI that actually works, I focus on practical outcomes over hype. I bring the technical depth of a solutions architect with the practical mindset of a founder — I've built companies, shipped products, and know what it takes to go from idea to execution. Based in Bavaria, Germany."
valueProposition: "I help you move from ideas to real results with AI and cloud — through clear guidance, practical steps, and hands-on coaching."
