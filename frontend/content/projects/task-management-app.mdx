depth:
  problem: "Small teams needed a lightweight alternative to enterprise project management tools. Existing solutions were either too complex or lacked real-time collaboration features."
  approach: "Built a Kanban-style board with real-time sync using WebSockets. Focused on a clean, intuitive interface that requires minimal onboarding. Implemented optimistic updates for instant feedback."
  tradeoffs:
    - decision: "WebSocket vs polling for real-time updates"
      alternatives:
        - "Long polling"
        - "Server-Sent Events"
        - "WebSocket connections"
      reasoning: "WebSockets provided bidirectional communication needed for collaborative editing. The connection overhead was acceptable given the interactive nature of the app."
    - decision: "PostgreSQL vs MongoDB for data storage"
      alternatives:
        - "MongoDB for flexible schemas"
        - "PostgreSQL for relational data"
      reasoning: "Task relationships (boards, lists, cards, assignments) mapped naturally to relational data. PostgreSQL's JSONB columns provided flexibility where needed."
  outcomes:
    - metric: "Active Teams"
      value: "500+"
      context: "Teams actively using the platform monthly"
    - metric: "Sync Latency"
      value: "<100ms"
      context: "Average time for changes to propagate to other users"
    - metric: "Uptime"
      value: "99.9%"
      context: "Over 12 months of production operation"
  reflections: "Would implement offline support from the start. Adding it later required significant refactoring. Also would consider using a CRDT library for conflict resolution instead of custom logic."
