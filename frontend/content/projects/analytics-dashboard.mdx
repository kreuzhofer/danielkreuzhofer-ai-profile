  problem: "Business users needed to visualize complex datasets without relying on data analysts for every report. Existing BI tools were expensive and required extensive training."
  approach: "Created a drag-and-drop dashboard builder with pre-built chart components. Used D3.js for custom visualizations and GraphQL for flexible data queries. Implemented a widget system allowing users to save and share dashboard configurations."
  tradeoffs:
    - decision: "D3.js vs charting library (Chart.js, Recharts)"
      alternatives:
        - "Chart.js for simple charts"
        - "Recharts for React integration"
        - "D3.js for full customization"
      reasoning: "D3.js provided the flexibility needed for custom visualizations that matched specific business requirements. The learning curve was worth the customization capabilities."
    - decision: "GraphQL vs REST for data API"
      alternatives:
        - "REST endpoints per chart type"
        - "GraphQL for flexible queries"
      reasoning: "GraphQL allowed frontend to request exactly the data needed for each widget, reducing over-fetching and enabling user-defined queries without backend changes."
  outcomes:
    - metric: "Report Generation Time"
      value: "90% reduction"
      context: "From hours of analyst work to minutes of self-service"
    - metric: "User Adoption"
      value: "200+ users"
      context: "Across 15 departments in the organization"
    - metric: "Dashboard Load Time"
      value: "<2 seconds"
      context: "For dashboards with up to 12 widgets"
  reflections: "Would invest more in data caching strategies earlier. As datasets grew, query performance became a bottleneck. Also would add more guided templates for common use cases to reduce the learning curve."
