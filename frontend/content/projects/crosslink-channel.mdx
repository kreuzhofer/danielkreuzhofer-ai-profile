  problem: "The maker community needed accessible, practical educational content on 3D printing, scanning, and design that bridges the gap between hobbyist and professional workflows."
  approach: "Created a YouTube channel with hands-on tutorials and demonstrations. Built supporting full-stack tools using TypeScript, Python, and React to enhance the content creation workflow and provide value to viewers."
  tradeoffs:
    - decision: "Video platform selection"
      alternatives:
        - "Self-hosted video platform"
        - "YouTube for discoverability"
        - "Multi-platform distribution"
      reasoning: "YouTube provides the best discoverability and community features for educational content, making it easier to reach the maker community."
    - decision: "Content focus"
      alternatives:
        - "Broad maker content"
        - "Specialized 3D printing focus"
        - "Software development tutorials"
      reasoning: "Specializing in 3D printing, scanning, and design creates a clear niche while leveraging personal expertise and passion."
  outcomes:
    - metric: "Channel Growth"
      value: "Active community"
      context: "Built engaged audience interested in 3D printing and design"
    - metric: "Tools Developed"
      value: "Multiple applications"
      context: "Full-stack tools supporting content creation and community"
  reflections: "Combining technical expertise with content creation provides unique value. The channel serves as both a creative outlet and a way to give back to the maker community."
