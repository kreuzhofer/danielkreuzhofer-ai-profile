depth:
  problem: "Needed a portfolio that respects visitors' time while providing depth for those who want it. Traditional portfolios either overwhelm with information or lack substance."
  approach: "Implemented a progressive disclosure pattern with summary and depth layers. Content is stored in MDX files for easy updates without code changes. Built with accessibility as a core requirement, leveraging Kiro for AI-assisted development."
  tradeoffs:
    - decision: "Single-page vs multi-page architecture"
      alternatives:
        - "Multi-page with separate routes for each section"
        - "Single-page with anchor navigation"
      reasoning: "Single-page provides faster navigation and simpler state management for expand/collapse interactions, while still supporting deep linking."
    - decision: "AI-assisted development"
      alternatives:
        - "Traditional manual development"
        - "AI-assisted with Kiro"
      reasoning: "Using Kiro for AI-assisted development accelerated the build process while maintaining high code quality and demonstrating practical AI tooling."
  outcomes:
    - metric: "Development Speed"
      value: "Accelerated"
      context: "AI-assisted development with Kiro significantly reduced build time"
    - metric: "Accessibility"
      value: "WCAG compliant"
      context: "Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support"
  reflections: "This project demonstrates practical AI-assisted development workflows. The combination of modern frameworks and AI tooling creates an efficient development experience."
