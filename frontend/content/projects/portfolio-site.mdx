depth:
  problem: "Needed a portfolio that respects visitors' time while providing depth for those who want it. Traditional portfolios either overwhelm with information or lack substance."
  approach: "Implemented a progressive disclosure pattern with summary and depth layers. Content is stored in MDX files for easy updates without code changes. Built with accessibility as a core requirement, not an afterthought."
  tradeoffs:
    - decision: "Single-page vs multi-page architecture"
      alternatives:
        - "Multi-page with separate routes for each section"
        - "Single-page with anchor navigation"
      reasoning: "Single-page provides faster navigation and simpler state management for expand/collapse interactions, while still supporting deep linking."
    - decision: "Custom components vs UI library"
      alternatives:
        - "Use Chakra UI or similar"
        - "Build custom Tailwind components"
      reasoning: "Custom components gave full control over bundle size and accessibility implementation, important for a portfolio showcasing frontend skills."
  outcomes:
    - metric: "Lighthouse Performance"
      value: "98/100"
      context: "Achieved through static generation and optimized assets"
    - metric: "Accessibility Score"
      value: "100/100"
      context: "WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with full keyboard navigation"
    - metric: "Time to Interactive"
      value: "1.2 seconds"
      context: "On simulated 3G connection"
  reflections: "Would explore using a headless CMS for content management if the site needed frequent updates from non-technical users. The MDX approach works well for developer-maintained content."
